# AR2

## 6 axis stepper motor robot and control software

```diff
*** PROJECT UPDATES (JULY 2018) ***
-Kickstarter was put on hold to explore lower cost suppliers.
-Aluminum kits are on order and expected soon - price will be less than half of the kickstarter prices.
-As soon as parts are received a website will be created to sell not only aluminum components but also complete hardware kits. 
-ROS development is currently in process.
```

The AR2 is a small desktop robot that is modeled similar to an industrial 6 axis robot.  This is a DIY project that can be built from 3D printed components or from machined aluminum components, uses low cost stepper motors and arduino controller.

This project includes:

- Bi of materials
- CAD files to 3D print components to build the robot
- Arduino sketch for stepper driver control
- Software to program and operate robot
- Kinematic model

All geared stepper motors and drivers are available from  [www.omc-stepperonline.com](https://www.omc-stepperonline.com/?tracking=59c1139e8987b) and all other misc. hardware are off-the-shelf items available from multiple sources (see the bill of materials info within each manual).

Its important to me that this project is free and available to everyone but any donations that
can help with all that has gone into it would be hugely appreciated.  Thank you very much.
